I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Intelligent Medical Engineering at the School of Medicine, Tianjin University, with expected graduation in June 2026.  My current research focuses on **electrochemical biosensing, flexible and wearable biosensors, functional material engineering for electrode surface modification, point-of-care (POCT) in vitro diagnostics, and organic field-effect transistors (OFET)**. My Master’s thesis centers on a comprehensive research project involving the development of multiple multi-channel, multi-modal electrochemical biosensors for disease biomarker detection across various biological fluids. 

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Intelligent Medical Engineering from Tianjin University, with a minor in Basic Medical Sciences from Tianjin Medical University. And I was recommended for admission to the Master’s program without examination.
